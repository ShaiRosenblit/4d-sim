# Project Rules and Context

## Available Tools

### Playwright
- Playwright (`@playwright/test`) is installed in this project
- Use Playwright for browser automation, web scraping, testing, and UI interaction tasks
- The package is available as a dev dependency
- When creating Playwright scripts, use TypeScript and run them with `npx tsx <script-name>.ts`
- **IMPORTANT**: Always check the terminal output for the actual dev server port before creating Playwright scripts
  - Don't assume default ports (e.g., 5173 for Vite)
  - Look at the background dev server output to get the correct port
  - If port is in use, Vite will automatically use another port (e.g., 3001, 3002, etc.)
- Common use cases:
  - Taking screenshots of websites
  - Extracting content from web pages
  - Automated testing of web applications
  - Simulating user interactions
  - Capturing visual elements and their properties

## Project Structure
- This is a TypeScript-based project using Vite as the build tool
- Main source code is in the `src/` directory
- Uses Three.js for 3D graphics/simulations
